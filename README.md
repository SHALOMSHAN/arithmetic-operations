# Arithmetic Operations

## Introduction

Arithmetic operations in batch scripting can be performed using the set /a command. For example, to add two numbers, you can use the following syntax:

```
set /a result=number1 + number2
```

You can also use other arithmetic operators such as - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulus). For example, to multiply two numbers:

```
set /a result=number1 * number2
```

You can also use the result of one arithmetic operation in another operation. For example, to calculate the result of (2*3)+4

```
set /a result=2*3+4
```

If you want to use the value stored in a variable in the arithmetic operation, you have to use the variable name without any special symbol like '$' or '%' . Example :

```
set /a result=2*number1+4
```

In addition, you can also use parentheses to specify the order of operations.

Note that the set command will save the result of the operation into the variable 'result' in this case, and you can use the variable in your script as you would any other variable.
